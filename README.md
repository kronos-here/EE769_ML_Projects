# EE769 ML Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the EE769 - Introduction to Machine Learning course at IIT Bombay. 
The projects focus on regression, classification (image and non-image), clustering, dimensionality reduction optimization and evaluation of ML models.

## Projects
1. **Project 1:** Bees vs Ants Classification Using Transfer Learning
   - Implemented transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet model to classify images of bees and ants.
   - Notebook: `project_1_name.ipynb`

2. **Project 2:** Comprehensive Classifier Testing and Parameter Optimization
   - Compared multiple classifiers and fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
   - Notebook: `project_2_name.ipynb`

3. **Project 3:** [Add description of the third project here]
   - Notebook: `project_3_name.ipynb`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pytorch
