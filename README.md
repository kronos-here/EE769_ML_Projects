# EE769 Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases the projects completed as part of the **EE769 - Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **IIT Bombay**. The projects encompass various machine learning tasks, including regression, classification (both image and non-image), clustering, dimensionality reduction, optimization, and model evaluation.

## Project Folders Overview

1. **Regression Model built from scratch**
   - **Description:** Implemented regression to predict the surface temperature of the Sun using sorted-out astronomical parameters.

2. **Comprehensive Classifier Testing and Parameter Optimization**
   - **Description:** Compared the performance metrics of multiple classifiers and auto-selected (based on the dataset) hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to identify the optimal model.

3. **Image Classifier, Clustering of Data and Data Feature Engineering
   - 1. Bees vs Ants Image Classification and Feature Extraction using a pre-trained Network and finetuning it,
   - 2. K-Means Clustering of unknown Numerical Data
   - 3. Feature Engineering of Data using PCA
   - 4. Feature Engineering using Kernelized PCA
